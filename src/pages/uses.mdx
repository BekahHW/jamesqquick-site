## Recording + Streaming Hardware

- Main camera for streaming and YouTube is the [Sony A6400](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Alpha-a6400-Mirrorless-International/dp/B095HXN4G3) with the [Sigma 16mm lens](https://www.amazon.com/Sigma-16mm-Contemporary-Lens-Sony/dp/B077BWD2BB) that runs through the [El Gato Camlink](https://amazon.com/Elgato-Cam-Link-Broadcast-Camcorder/dp/B07K3FN5MR).
- My secondary camera that I use for TikToks is the [Canon M50](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Mirrorless-4728C006-Cleaning-International/dp/B0B431RR83) with [Sigma 16mm lens](https://www.amazon.com/Sigma-Contemporary-Extreme-Travel-Bundle/dp/B084KYHYKN)
- My main microphone is the [Shure Sm7b](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M) mounted on the [Rode PSA 1 Boom Arm](https://www.amazon.com/Rode-PSA-1-PSA1/dp/B001D7UYBO). I run an XLR cable from the microphone to the [DBX 286s Preamp](https://www.amazon.com/dbx-286s-Microphone-Channel-Processor/dp/B004LWH79A) and from there into the [Scarlet 2i2 Interface](https://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B07QR73T66).
- My travel/backup microphone is the [Shure MV7](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML) that I can plug in using XLR or USB directly to the computer. I also carry a smaller microphone, the [Sennheiser MKE 400](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-MKE-400-Shotgun-Microphone/dp/B08YS34YRS)
- For lights, I use two [El Gato Key Lights](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Key-Light-Professional-App-Enabled/dp/B07L755X9G) as well as a [cheap ring light](https://www.amazon.com/Tripod-Ringlight-Totally-Recording-Meeting/dp/B082P2GZR1).
- I also use a [Streamdeck](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-MK-2-Controller/dp/B09738CV2G) for some automation while recording.
- I use a M1 Macbook Pro Max with 64GB of ram and 1TB SSD.

## Recording, Editing, and Steaming Software

- I primarily use [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) for both recording and editing. It's the best option I've found for recording multiple separate feeds at once (webcam and desktop). The editing experience is ok...
- For streaming, I am currently using [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/). It's the easiest tool I've found for streaming although I have less control/customization than I would if I used OBS.

## Terminal

I use the [Hyper Terminal](https://hyper.is/) with the [Fig](https://fig.io/) plugin (it's AMAZING!!). I ZSH as the shell and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) for managing packages, configurations, etc. Lastly, I use the [Cobalt 2 theme in Hyper](https://github.com/wesbos/hyperterm-cobalt2-theme)

## Visual Studio Code Setup

- I rotate between a few different themes: [Midnight Synth](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ekelley.midnight-synth), [Cobalt 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2), [Shades of Purple](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple), [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl), [codeStackr](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codestackr.codestackr-theme), and [Astro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Astro.Astro)
- I use the [Cascadia Code font](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) which is free from Microsoft with Font Ligatures turned on. [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is another great free option.
