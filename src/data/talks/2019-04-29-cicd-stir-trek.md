With all the advancements in the tooling around CI and CD, implementing the technology has never been easier. Helping your team embrace the cultural change necessary to follow this cycle… that’s another story. In this talk, you’ll learn the true meaning of CI/CD — that’s Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, if you don’t speak alphabet soup — and the various principles that drive it. To embrace these principles, you’ll need to change your team’s mindset, which can be a tough transition. I lead this transition in my organization, and I will walk you through the lessons I learned. After this talk, you will have a clear understanding of CI/CD as well as how to implement a true cultural shift in your team to take full advantage of this new, powerful methodology.
