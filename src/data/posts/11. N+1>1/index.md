A couple of weeks ago I posted an [article](https://www.jamesqquick.com/blog/i-got-corrected-on-my-second-day) about an interaction I had with the CTO at Auth0, [Matias Woloski](https://twitter.com/woloski). On just my second day, I got feedback from Matias about how I could improve my pitch for who we (Auth0) are and what we do. At the time, I related this back to one of our core pillars, "We give a shit". After thinking about it more, it also brings up another one of our core pillars, "N+1>N".

## What Does N+1>N Mean?

It's simple. Next time, do better. Next time, improve on last time. Don't be afraid to try. Make next time better than the last time. At Auth0, we aren't afraid to make mistakes because those become learning opportunities. It's a core tennat of Agile, but it's something that is effectively instituted.

You can imagine, at times, that it is hard to have a positive attitutude towards failure. I've been in situations with a "blame culture", where the end goal is to find the person to blame. That mentatlity in that situation is not looking towards the future. It's not focusing on what we learned to make sure we do it better next time. It's not focused on the fact that people are human.

## How Do You Explain Auth0

Well, the good thing is that Matias gave me a cheat sheet. I love how he broke it down based on different potential audiences. I think that's really important. As a speaker, it's my repsonsiblity to adapt my message to the people I'm speaking to. Matias understands that.

### 20 Second Pitch

> "Think about Auth0 like your authentication and authorization microservice. Butâ€¦ built by hundreds of people, with all the features that would take you a long time to build yourself. That is operated for you, always improving, with advanced security features and great reliability and scalability."

The 1 minute speech is a lot longer, so I'll leave that to your imagination. Or...maybe you'll hear it from me in person!

### Non-tech Friends/Parents Pitch

> "You enter users and passwords everywhere on the internet, right? Well, a developer has to implement all that. We provide that as a service for them, so they spend time implementing their application instead."

### Grandma Pitch

I like this one a lot.

> "We make the internet safer."
