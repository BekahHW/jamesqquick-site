As many of you know, my first day at Auth0 was Monday, January 6th, and like the 29 other new employees, I traveled to Seattle for a week of training. That morning, in all of my excitement, I recorded and shared a video explainig how thrilled I was to be starting. The next day, I got this.

Don't know who Mattias is? Well, he's the CTO of the company. So here was my initial reaction.

**...SHIT I messed up already! lol**

But the more I read it, I realized it was much more complimentary and constructive than negative. Also, the longer I thought about it, I started to realize how telling his comment was. Here's what I mean.

## He Gives a Shit

First off, before you judge me for being to vulgar, I should clarify that one of the core pillars at Auth0 is "We Give a Shit!". I feel like that says a lot (in a good way) about the company, to be honest.

But here's what I've learned in previous companies. Very rarely do you hear about a core philosophy and get to truly experience it on day 2. This is literally **the CTO of the company**, and he not only saw my post (I doubt he followed me before), he also took the time to respond to me with feedback. As part of the response, he also toko the time to write a blog post that he thought would help me and others in the compnay.

For me, it shows that he cares, that he's aware, and he wants to help.

## This is the Culture I was Looking For

Culturally, Auth0 is exactly what I was looking for when searching for jobs. Previously, I worked for FedEx and Microsoft, which are incredibly large organizations. In both places, I struggled a bit with the size. At Microsoft, I felt like it was hard to make connections with other teams. At FedEx, my network was stronger, but I felt like it was hard to get clearly defined work (too many cooks in the kitchen situation).

Auth0, so far, seems like the polar opposite. They are relatively small (for me). We just crossed 600+ employees with my cohort. Because of this, it's much easier to build relationships. I've already gotten to meet the 30 in my cohort, several other people in the office, and several people online in Slack. Not to mention, I've already been noticed by my CTO :).

> My first week showed me that my expecations were spot on. I joined a younger (but established) company with a modern culture and loads of passion.

## Transparency

Transparency is something that people talk about, but rarely live up to it. Personally, it's something I work on constantly, and more specifically, I focus on three things.

- feeling comfortable reveiving (eagerly) constructive feedback
- feeling comfortable giving constructive feedback
- always setting appropriate expectations up front (no sugar coating)

It may not seem obvious, but to me, the comment that Mattias made shows me that transparency is real at Auth0. He was clear... It was cool that I created the video, but I can (and should) do a better job at articulating what the company does in the future.

> I'm always looking for feedback so that I can grow as a person and as an employee

He gave me a learning opportunity that could also be leveraged across the company.

## Wrap up

In general, I'm genuinely incredibly excited to be a part of Auth0. Every interaction so far has lived up to everything I was hoping it would be. Maybe one day I can give a new employee the same positive experience that Mattias gave me.
