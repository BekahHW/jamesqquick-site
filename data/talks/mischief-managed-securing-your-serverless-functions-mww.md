description: The difficulty of building a website grows exponentially when taking into account security. Even a basic webpage quickly evolves with the need to interact with data sources, protect API credentials, etc. In this talk, we will discuss what Serverless Functions are, why you might use them, and how to protect them.  We'll talk through common security holes you need to address while touching on topics like authentication, authorization, and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). After this talk, you should walk away confident in your mischief managing abilities.
