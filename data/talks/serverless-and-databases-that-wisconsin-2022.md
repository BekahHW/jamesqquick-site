description: As application architectures evolve, the tools you depend on have to as well. Unfortunately for you, the database is no exception. With the growing popularity of serverless, do you understand how your database needs to evolve?

In this talk, we’ll start with a brief level set on what serverless is. Then, we’ll look at a few key pain points that traditional databases have while working in a serverless environment: scale, management/deployment, and developer experience. You should walk away excited and prepared to build your next application leveraging the power of a serverless database.
